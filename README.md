# IBU_Calculator

This is just a small project for my homebrewing calculations. Sometimes, when brewing, I came to a point where my sugar extraction before boiling was lower than expected, 
therefore the IBU resulting from hops addition would be higher than expected. With this simple calculator I can recalculate the amount of hops to add to obtain
the same IBU as in the recipe.
