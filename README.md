# IBU_Calculator

This is just a small project for my homebrewing calculations. Sometimes, when brewing, I came to a point where my sugar extraction before boiling was lower than expected, 
therefore the IBU* resulting from hops addition would be higher than expected. With this simple calculator I can recalculate the amount of hops to add to obtain
the same IBU as in the recipe.

The OG Post Boil Calculator lets you estimate what the SG will be in your fermentor given a starting volume, a desired volume and the gravity before boil.
The IBU calculator will recalculate the amount of hops to add during boil given starting conditions.


* IBU is a unit of measure of alpha-acids extracted from hops into the wort during boil and is, therefore, a measurement of bitterness in beer.
